Dustin is a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uh.edu), University of Houston, Texas. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/).

Working at *Quantitative Imaging Lab (QIL)* under the supervision of Professor [Shishir Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gJ3JGSsAAAAJ&hl=en), his research focuses on **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**. He is working actively on [Person Re-Identification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/person-re-identification#:~:text=It%20involves%20detecting%20and%20tracking,a%20robust%20and%20efficient%20manner.), where he develops feature extraction models to re-identify persons of interest, serving surveillance and public safety purposes. Besides, he is interested in working on **3D Generation and Reconstruction**, where he explores the application of Generative AI models (GANs, NeRF, Diffusion) and Vision-Language models (CLIP, Florence 2) in this 3D Vision task.
